# The Tea Room - Bubble Tea Store Wordpress Website

## Designed and Developed by: Daniel Guinto

The Tea Room is a made-up bubble tea shop website built using the Wordpress Content Management System.

This personal project was my introduction to Wordpress where I implemented "from-scratch" development, as opposed to working off of an existing theme. The layout, design, and back-end functionality were coded from scratch. However, users are still able to utilize Wordpress' Content Management System to update specific text blocks, titles, and images.

The idea behind this project was to create the general structure of a website for a client, while still providing them with an easy way to update components of the site on their own.
